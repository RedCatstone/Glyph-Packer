# Glyph Packer

Glyph Packer is a fun little website where you get to pack different glyphs/textures into a small area. The glyphs are a few pixels in a small grid. The default glyph-packs are:
- Numbers
- Letters
- Tetris Pieces
- Pentominos

Here is an example of the smallest way (i know of) to pack the numbers, with the 4 being highlighted:

# Extra Stuff
for each pack there are 5 mode options (just for the extra challenge):
- Any Rotation/Mirror
- Any Rotation
- Normal
- All Rotations
- All Rotations/Mirror

# Future Plans
I plan on adding:
- saving of highscores on each mode/pack.
- custom pack creations
- sharing a custom pack over clipboard
- making the layout better in general/for mobile
